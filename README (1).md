# 🌾 AI-Driven Smart Agriculture and Crop Health Monitoring Framework

## 🚀 Project Overview
Agriculture is a critical backbone of the Indian economy, yet farmers continue to face challenges such as crop diseases, climate variability, inefficient resource usage, and delayed decision-making. Traditional farming methods rely heavily on manual inspection, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable.

This project proposes an **AI-driven smart agriculture framework** that integrates **machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics** to monitor crop health, detect leaf diseases, and support data-driven agricultural decisions. The system is designed to be **affordable, scalable, and suitable for Indian farming conditions**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Early detection of crop leaf diseases using AI
- Reduce crop loss and increase yield
- Minimize excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides
- Provide a scalable and farmer-friendly solution
- Support sustainable and precision agriculture

---

## 🧠 Proposed Solution
The proposed system uses **deep learning-based image classification** to detect diseases from leaf images. Farmers or users can upload crop leaf images, and the system predicts the disease class along with confidence scores.
